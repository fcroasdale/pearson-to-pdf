# pearson-to-pdf
Pyautogui way to download the pages from a textbook. Uses pyautogui which is SO gank. Used this to download my textbook.

I was only compelled to release this publically just for if anyone else was wondering how they could export to pdf from pearson. Just a proof of concept. 

Once you're logged into pearson you can make a call to the image src url and it will download the file. Rinse and repeat for all the pages. Didn't want to deal with header details using requests, this was the easiest way.
